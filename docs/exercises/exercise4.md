## Exercise 4: Page Rank Algorithm

### Introduction
One of the most vital concepts behind how Google ranks all the indexed websites is the so called «Page Rank Algorithm». 
First introduced and patented by Larry Page in 1998 [^1] this algorithm describes a method to assign a weight to every
page in the index depending on how many other pages link to that page and on the weight these pages have themselves.
In this article we'll cover the mechanics of the algorithm itself and some mathematical basics on which the algorithm relies on, such as the Markov-Chain and the Eigenvalue-problem.

### Eigenvalue and Eigenvectors
In order to better understand the mathematics behind, we need to cover a topic called «Eigenvalue/Eigenvector» first. 
Let's assume we have the following Matrix:

$\begin{bmatrix}1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4\end{bmatrix}$
