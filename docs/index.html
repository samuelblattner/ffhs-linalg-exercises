<h1>LinAlg Exercises</h1>

<h2>General notes on architecture</h2>
This is a JavaFX application which is split up into two major packages: The <strong>Application-Package</strong> and the <strong>Exercises-Package</strong>.

<h3>Application-Package</h3>
This package contains the main entry point of the application (<i>class Main</i>). The <i>Main</i> class loads the main window that will contain all exercises
in a TabPane so that each Tab represents and loads one exercise. The <i>ApplicationController</i> class is assigned as controller to the application via the
<i>application.fxml</i> user interface.

The <i>ApplicationController</i> is responsible for loading the individual exercises dynamically into the tabs of the TabPane. After the main window has successfully
loaded, the <i>Main</i> class calls the controller to initialize the tabs and load the first exercise.

All exercises must implement the <i>ifExercise</i> interface.

<h3>Exercises-Package</h3>
Since many of the exercises are going to use common components, it is a good idea to only implement them once and make them available to the exercises. Here's a short
description on the common parts:

<h4>ifCanvasDrawable interface</h4>
This interface must be implemented by all objects that need to be drawn on a JavaFX Canvas. Drawables will be iteratively called by the main render routine using the
<i>draw</i> method and by passing a GraphicsContext reference. Thus, the actual process of drawing is delegated to the individual drawables themselves since they know
best how to do it. The only thing that is decided by the class rendering the scene is <i>where (which GraphicsContext)</i> and <i>when</i> the objects are drawn.

<h4>AbstractExercise class</h4>
