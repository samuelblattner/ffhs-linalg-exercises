<h1>LinAlg Exercises</h1>

<h2>General notes on architecture</h2>
This is a JavaFX application which is split up into two major packages: The <strong>Application-Package</strong> and the <strong>Exercises-Package</strong>.

<h3>Application-Package</h3>
This package contains the main entry point of the application (<i>class Main</i>). The <i>Main</i> class loads the main window that will contain all exercises
in a TabPane so that each Tab represents and loads one exercise. The <i>ApplicationController</i> class is assigned as controller to the application via the
<i>application.fxml</i> user interface.

The <i>ApplicationController</i> is responsible for loading the individual exercises dynamically into the tabs of the TabPane. After the main window has successfully
loaded, the <i>Main</i> class calls the controller to initialize the tabs and load the first exercise.

<h2>Exercise 1: "Wohin klickt die Maus?" (en: "Where was the mouse clicked?")</h2>
